As a freelance web developer 

I want to generate a simple logo for my projects

So that I don't have to pay a graphic designer

Given a command-line application that accepts user input

When I am prompted for text

Then I can enter up to three characters

When I am prompted for the text color

Then I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

When I am prompted for a shape

Then I am presented with a list of shapes to choose from: circle, triangle, and square

When I am prompted for the shape's color

Then I can enter a color keyword (OR a hexadecimal number)

When I have entered input for all the prompts

Then an SVG file is created named `logo.svg`

And the output text "Generated logo.svg" is printed in the command line

When I open the `logo.svg` file in a browser

Then I am shown a 300x200 pixel image that matches the criteria I entered
